          Hello, my name is Daniel, I am 15 years old, and I am trying to reach my goals. I want to show the world (at least a part of it), that I have talent and creativity. Sometimes, I assemble computers. My goal for this project is to succeed... Maybe it will happen sometime. Satisfied clients are the most important thing for me. So I always wish their dreams to come true.
